# Zira

Zira is an experimental programming language written in Rust, designed as a learning and practicing purposes.

## Project overview

- Purpose: Zira is primarily a learning project, offering insights into programming language mechanics.
- Inspiration: Inspired and learned from [Eldiro project](https://github.com/lunacookies/eldiro). Thank [Aramis](https://xoria.org/) for [your excellent works](https://lunacookies.github.io/lang/).
- Licence: [MIT](./LICENCE)

## Cool ideas for Zira

- Lexer and parser: Implement a robust lexer and parser to tokenize Zira code and construct an abstract syntax tree (AST).
- Syntax exploration: Design a clean, expressive syntax for Zira, focusing on readability and writability.
- Built-in functions: Add basic built-in functions like arithmetic operations and string manipulation.
- Control flow: Implement conditionals, loops, and possibly pattern matching.
  Error Handling: Explore graceful error handling inspired by Rustâ€™s Result and Option types.
- Standard library: Develop a small standard library with useful utilities such as data structures and file I/O.
- Testing: Comprehensive testing covering various aspects, including edge cases.
